# ROS2 Gazebo Simulation for Turtlebot3 Navigation with Deep Reinforcement Learning
In this project, we delve into the fascinating intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and simulation, focusing on the navigation of a Turtlebot3 robot in a complex Gazebo-simulated environment. Leveraging the power of ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), we create a dynamic and responsive simulation that forms the foundation of our experiments with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

Key Components:
- ROS2: Acts as the backbone of our project, facilitating seamless communication between the different components of the robotic system and the simulation environment.
- Gazebo Simulation: Provides a realistic and intricate 3D environment where our Turtlebot3 robot navigates. The simulation includes obstacles and walls, creating scenarios akin to real-world navigation challenges.
- Turtlebot3 Robot: A versatile and widely-used robotic platform that serves as the agent in our DRL experiments. It navigates through the Gazebo environment, making decisions based on sensor inputs and learning algorithms.
- Deep Reinforcement Learning: At the core of our project, DRL algorithms enable the Turtlebot3 to learn efficient navigation strategies through trial and error, optimizing its pathfinding abilities over time.
